# **Pizza Place API - 24 hour code challenge**

## Getting started 

1. First you need to setup your environment, inside the project there is a folder named Documentation inside that there are 2 folders csv files and db schema.
2. Let's focus first on the folder db schema inside that there are two files
   - pizza place db schema_only.sql
   - pizza place db schema and data.sql
3. Please go into your database and create a database with the name
   - PizzaPlaceDB
   - Please run the file you want from step 2.
4. Once that is done.
5. You may now start to the API you can use the built-in user interface with swagger or you can use postman if you want.

6. If you ran the schema and data file from step 2 you do not need to follow the next step
7. Assuming you ran the sql script schema only you now have the schema but now data yet. This is where the csv files folder from the Documentation folder is helpful.
8. From swagger i have created endpoints where you can upload the csv data and the API will import that to the database.
